Final Project Week 1 Status Report
Written by Christopher Thurn

What do we need to do?
•	Create a Pitcher class for the batting statistics for a player on the team.
•	Create a graphical user interface that can be used to collect data about each pitcher in a game.
•	Once the data has been entered, it should be written out to a file identified by the date of the game.  Each pitcher’s statistics should be added to the file for that date. The format of the file is up to the team to decide, binary, flat or SQL-DB it is your decision.
•	When the file is read, it should produce a report that lists the statistics for all pitchers in that game and calculates the earned run average for each pitcher. The report should be saved in a file in a format for printing.
•	There should also be a program that will read multiple game files and summarize the statistics on each pitcher for a specified number of games.

Communication Log:
As of April 24th, 2020 – No Word from Michael.

Work Log:
Friday, April 17th, 2020 – Designed a simple Switch Program that allows a user to input the Player Name, Age, Number and Gender. No submit button or data entry to create a file to input this data.

Thursday, April 23rd, 2020 – 
•	Redesigned the Program to take JavaFX rather than Switch.
•	Added Input fields for all necessary information needed. 
•	Added Validation on Submit to ensure all fields are filled out and are correct data types.
•	Created Validator.java to perform validation of the form.
•	Added necessary buttons for form functionality.
