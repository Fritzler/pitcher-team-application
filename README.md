# pitcher-team-application
This is the Java Application for the Pitcher Team.

The members of this team are:

1. Ethan Kohn – Lead
2. Michael Morcos
3. Christopher Thurn

The goal of this team is to: 

Create a Pitcher class for the batting statistics for a player on the team.

Create a graphical user interface that can be used to collect data about each pitcher in a game.

Once the data has been entered, it should be written out to a file identified by the date of the game.

Each pitcher’s statistics should be added to the file for that date. 

The format of the file is up to the team to decide, binary, flat or SQL-DB it is your decision.

When the file is read, it should produce a report that lists the statistics for all pitchers in that game and calculates the earned run average for each pitcher. 

The report should be saved in a file in a format for printing.

There should also be a program that will read multiple game files and summarize the statistics on each pitcher for a specified number of games.
