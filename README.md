The goal of this team is to: 

Create a Pitcher class for the batting statistics for a player on the team. - Achieved

Create a graphical user interface that can be used to collect data about each pitcher in a game. - Achieved

Once the data has been entered, it should be written out to a file identified by the date of the game. - Achieved

Each pitcher’s statistics should be added to the file for that date. - Achieved

The format of the file is up to the team to decide, binary, flat or SQL-DB it is your decision. - Achieved - Flat

When the file is read, it should produce a report that lists the statistics for all pitchers in that game and calculates the earned run average for each pitcher. - Achieved.

The report should be saved in a file in a format for printing. - Achieved? They are saved as txt files which can be opened and saved.
Also they print out in the console, allowing the user to copy and paste currently.

There should also be a program that will read multiple game files and summarize the statistics on each pitcher for a specified number of games.
